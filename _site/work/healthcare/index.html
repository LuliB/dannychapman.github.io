<h3>Creating a reassuring user experience</h3>

<p>Roughly a year after the failed rollout and subsequent fix of healthcare.gov, I joined a small agile team tasked with building a feature sorely missed in Healthcare.gov 1.0: Window shopping for insurance plans. Unlike almost any other e-commerce solution, Healthcare.gov 1.0 did not let you comparison shop for plans, up front. Instead, a complex registration process preceeded any ability to see just what it was you were able to purchase. Window shopping in version 2.0 changed that.</p>

<p>As designer on the team, I designed the user experience that enables all Americans qualified to purchase Insurance through the exchange to quickly see plans associated pricing available to them. This project presented a number of interesting design challanges: an agressive timeline, existing design and UX standards, and front end experience that needed to be unified with rest of the healthcare.gov experience.</p>

<p>After analyzing the user research and data from Healthcare.gov 1.0, it quickly became apparent the UX challenges we would face in designing this product. For most Americans, purchasing Health Insurance was a high stress experience, much like filing your taxes. If we were going to overcome this challenge, we'd have to create an experience that reassured users every step of the way. As a result, the user experience presents many opportunities to both see your progress, and quickly edit your existing steps as you progress through the application. The result has been a great success, enabling millions of Americans to quickly comparison shop from their desktop, tablet or smartphone.</p>
