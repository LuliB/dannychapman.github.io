When we think of government, design is seldom something that comes to mind. If it does, it's likely in the context of a flashy political campaign, not from the more pedestrian realm of actual governance. If we do thing about design and government, we instead think of forms, bureaucracy, soulless buildings, and confusing processes we seldom understand. When something goes badly with these interactions, we typically roll our eyes, shrug and move on with our day. 

As a designer working on government-related things for the past eight years, I’ve waded  elbows deep into fixing government processes online. The difference between private sector and public sector engagement online is large, but the gap is closing. There are in fact significant signs of hope. Last year, the White House released the [White House Digital Strategy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html)
 — a document that clearly makes note of the critical role design with play in the primary interaction points between citizens and their government. Responsive design, device-agnostic approaches, and a significant focus on mobile are all called out directly. Responsive design, called out in a government document! This year, The executive branch’s Open Data Policy was published not on government servers, but on GitHub. Not only that, the first commit, or edit to this document was a design improvement to my initial design. Collaborative Citizen to government interaction to improve our government, happening in a way that is transparent, open and available for everyone. A design edit to a government document hardly represents wholesale change in our democracy, but it is a start. 

The technology is no longer the challenge, as the tools we have at our disposal are many. [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
 and git hosting providers like [GitHub](http://www.github.com/) for [decentralized collaboration](http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html), HTML5 and CSS3 to create accessible device-agnostic open content, smartphone adoption helping to bridge our broadband gap are just a few of the tools we have at our disposal. 

The challenge is more fundamental — how do we as citizens engage, [not just on election day](http://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_pahlka_coding_a_better_government.html), but in the far less sexy process of governing? [Big, messy problems](http://www.dobt.co/blog/) are out there, but good design can and will provide a significant part of the solution. We just have to be willing to get our hands a little bit dirty and engage. Yesterday, I was inspired to see a fantastic cross-section of citizens do just that at a [Hackathon in Newark, NJ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hacknwk). While a hackathon is just a one-day event that can’t bring about fundamental change, it can spark something. If the citizens I saw rolling up their sleeves yesterday are anything to go by, we are in for something good over the next few years.
