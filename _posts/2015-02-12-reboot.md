This past year has been filled with a great deal of change for me. Almost one year ago in March 2014, I left eGovernment provider NIC after nine years. It was an extremely hard decision, but one I felt necessary for my growth and professional development. Since then, I've joined up with the talented team at [Ad Hoc LLC](http://adhocteam.us), serving as creative director. The applications we're building are already helping millions of Americans interact with government, and we're just getting started. I can't wait to share more.
