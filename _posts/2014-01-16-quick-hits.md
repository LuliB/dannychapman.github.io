#### Dave Cole
Regardless your political pursuasion, it's wonderful to see a true geek exploring a run for national office. [Dave Cole](https://twitter.com/dhcole) of [Mapbox fame](https://www.mapbox.com) is looking at a run in New Jersey's 2nd district. If you care about improving government tech, [this is a campaign to keep an eye on this year.] (http://www.coleforcongress.com)

#### Easel
Well this is interesting. Github's been making moves beyond sharing code for a while now, but this is the first attempt at bringing designer's into the fold. Smart move aquiring [Easel](http://blog.easel.io/blog/2014/01/06/easel-acquired-by-github/). This could make my earlier post about [designing in the open](http://dannychapman.com/2013/09/05/open-source-design/) much easier. 

#### Data.gov
A much needed refresh for the federal government's open data portal went live this week. Happy to see that after a lengthy journey from alpha.data.go and next.data.gov, this thing made it out the door. While there's certainly things I'd like to see improved, this is a great start. And, now that the [site is open source](https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/), it will be easy to help make improvements. Props to the [<abbr title="General Services Administration">GSA</abbr>](http://gsa.gov) team for pulling this off.
